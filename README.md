# AvantElements (plugin for Omeka Classic)

The AvantElements plugin adds data entry and validation features to the Omeka admin interface. These features help ensure data integrity and make data entry easier for archivists. The plugin provides the following:

* Auto creation of Identifier value when adding a new item.
* Identifier validation to ensure that the Identifier is unique.
* Bolder error messages.
* Clone item feature.
* Data validation for specific elements.
* Detection of carriage returns, leading/trailing spaces, and en/em dashes where prohibited.
* Date format validation.
* Control of field widths.
* Auto creation of links to other items having the same element value as the displayed item.
* Option to hide the HTML checkbox on any element.
* Option to hide the Add Input button on any element.
* Option to make an element required.
* Suggestion feature for Creator and Publisher fields.
* Automatic update of Creator and Publisher fields when a corresponding Title field is modified.


 > At this time, the AvantElements implementation is specific to the Southwest Harbor Public Library's [Digital Archive](http://swhplibrary.net/archive) and therefore **this plugin is not yet usable as-is for another Omeka installation**. However, the source code is provided here for the benefit of software developers who want to learn about the logic or adapt it for use on another project. 
This plugin was developed for the [Southwest Harbor Public Library](http://www.swhplibrary.org/), in Southwest Harbor, Maine. Funding was provided in part by the [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).
